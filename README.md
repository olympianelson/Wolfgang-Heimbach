# Sample visual essay

Wolfgang Heimbach was a North German Baroque painter born between the years 1605–1613 in Ovelgönne to Wolff Heimbach, a fruit and grain clerk from Thüringenin in central Germany. Wolfgang grew up in Oldenberg, approximately 30 kilometres from Ovelgönne.

It is not known specifically from whom Heimbach learnt the art of painting; although it has been suggested by Johann Just Winkelmann (1620–1699) that he was trained by a local painter before travelling to the Netherlands. His talent for painting and drawing was discovered by Count Anton Günther of Oldenburg (1583–1667). The count was a sponsor for Heimbach and sent him to the Netherlands to develop his talent in art. His stay in the Netherlands is likely to have taken place in the late 1620s or early 1630s. By 1636 he was back in Germany, where he painted an Interior Wedding Scene. It is not known for how long he stayed in Ovelgönne and Bremen, but it is known that around 1640 he arrived in Vienna from southern Germany, where he stayed until about 1642. There he painted a portrait of the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, a soldier, administrator and patron of the arts.

From Austria, Heimbach went south to Italy, where he stayed for about eleven years. Most of his time in Italy was spent in Naples, Rome and Florence, and is believed to have travelled north from 1651. He was held in high esteem by the Pope, cardinals and other noblemen due to the excellence of his art, which by then he could support with documents and letters. His work reveals knowledge of artists such as Carlo Saraceni and Domenico Fetti and possibly also of Caravaggio and his bamboccianti successors such as Gerrit van Honthorst (1592–1656), which is particularly evident in the genre scenes that were painted in Rome in the early 1640s. During this period, he worked for several noble families such as the Borghese, Doria Pamphilj and Medici. It has also been suggested that in 1645 he worked briefly for Pope Innocent X in Rome. In the same year he moved to Florence, where he worked for the ruling Medici family. In 1651, Heimbach went to Náchod (Bohemia), where he was employed at the Náchod Castle for the noble Duke of Amalfi and a Knight of Malta Octavio Piccolomini. In the same year he lived in Prague; and from Bohemia, it is believed that he travelled back to his hometown, planning to make stopovers in Nuremberg and Brussels.

In 1651 his return to Ovelgönne is documented where the following year, Heimbach was employed as court painter for Count Anton Günther von Oldenburg. The painter—who was sought and well-paid by Count Günther—is reported to have painted nine paintings in 26 weeks. For those nine works, he was paid 200 Reichstaler, which attests both to his prolific output and the high esteem in which he was held.
 
In 1653, Heimbach was employed as court painter to King Friedrich III. of Denmark and Norway where he was based in Copenhagen and remained for nearly ten years until 1662–1663.
